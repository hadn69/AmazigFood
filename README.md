Feel Free to Take Some Of The Code and Improve it. I am happy for you to use some of my code as long as it isn't a direct copy of this and the majority of the code in your mod is YOUR code. Changing variable names or whitespacing does not avoid this license. Also, don't use my textures, use your own. Do NOT rehost this mod on another site. i am happy for you to write a review or describe the mod on your website, blog or social media profile or whatever else, but link it back to MY download, on curse. the only exception to this is modpacks, but if you need to host it elsewhere ask my permission, although i highly reccomend to just use curse to host your pack, as you can use my mod without having to rehost it anywhere.

please notice that Shall you contribute, and i hope people do, you are granting me full right to use that code however i wish, whenever i wish.
